👤 About the Creator

I’m 16 years old. BitBreach is my personal project — built from scratch while learning electronics, firmware, and 3D design.

Some parts of this README and repository organization were polished with AI tools to make it easier to read and navigate, while all technical content and decisions are fully my own.
