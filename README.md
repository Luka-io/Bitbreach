## The Vision

This isnt some locked down Device
**BitBreach is yours.**

Make your own plugins. Flash your own firmware.
Mess it up. Reflash. Hack it again. Thats what real hackers do

Whether you want to build the next RFID app, learn how glitching works, or make a Tamagotchi that plays Doom — this is for you.

**Cheap. Hackable. Yours.**
**BitBreach** is not just a device. It’s a movement.

## About me

I’m 16 years old. BitBreach is my personal project — built from scratch while learning electronics, firmware, and 3D design.

Some parts of this README and repository organization were polished with AI tools to make it easier to read and navigate, while all technical content and decisions are fully my own.
