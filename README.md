# BitBreach

**Hack it. Crack it. Own it.**

A pocket-sized hacking and gaming device. Built by a 16-year-old who got tired of locked-down and expensive hardware.

## What is this?

BitBreach is a handheld multitool for security research, RF hacking, and retro gaming. It's powered by an ESP32-S3 and STM32G4, with support for Sub-GHz RF, LoRa mesh, NFC, WiFi, BLE, voltage glitching, and more.

No cloud. No subscriptions. No locked firmware. You own it.

**Size:** 100mm × 50mm × ~17mm (fits in your pocket)

## What can it do?

### RF & Radio
- **Sub-GHz:** Replay attacks, signal analysis (CC1101 with 3 switchable bands)
- **LoRa Mesh:** Anonymous communication over decentralized LoRa networks. Connect with other BitBreach devices or public LoRa infrastructure worldwide for off-grid messaging
- **WiFi/BLE:** Packet sniffing, deauth attacks, BLE scanning
- **NFC:** Clone cards, read/write tags, emulate credentials
- **IR:** Universal remote, brute-force IR codes

### Security
- **Voltage Glitching:** Fault injection for firmware extraction and bypass testing
- **EEPROM Challenges:** Unlock features by hacking your own device

### Gaming & Apps
- **Retro Emulation:** (RetroGo) ported to Bitbreach
- **Custom Apps:** SDK in development for community-built tools
- **Digital Pet:** Tamagotchi-style pet (because why not)

### AI Features
- Signal analysis using onboard AI (ESP32-S3)
- Pattern recognition for RF and protocol analysis

## LoRa Anonymous Mesh

BitBreach supports **LoRa mesh networking** for anonymous, off-grid communication:

- **Long-range:** Up to 10km in cities, 40km+ in rural areas
- **Decentralized:** No servers, no tracking
- **Anonymous:** Messages route through mesh nodes with no sender identification
- **Global network:** Connect to public LoRa infrastructure or create your own mesh
- **Use cases:** Protests, off-grid comms, emergency networks, privacy-focused messaging

Perfect for situations where internet and cell networks aren't an option—or when you don't want anyone watching.

## Who made this?

I'm 16, from Germany. I taught myself electronics, firmware, and hardware design. BitBreach started as a personal project and grew into something bigger.

Some parts of this README were cleaned up with AI tools for readability, but all technical decisions and design work are mine.
