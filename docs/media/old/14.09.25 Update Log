1 Month has passed since my last update 
I had/have a bunch of school work to do so i dont really have much time for the Projekt, but still here is a sneak peak

I finished :
Lipo Handling
Sd Handling
Main/Submenu Logik (with Icons and dynamicly addable Menus)
Usb Port MCU switching Host
Retro Go Firmware is Ported now and works (still needs some tweaks)
Speaker (Sounds)

Tested :
Nfc/Rfid Ic (works fine , not finished)
CC1101 (Sub Ghz) it has some wierd Problems with the Internal Registers , i found ways to fix it manually so i will have to rewrite RadioLib to work with it 
Stm32G431 works fine

Note :
I will maybe change the second C1101 out with an Lora IC , A small movement against the EU Chat Controll 
--> This wont Remove the Rolling Code double CC1101 Function , it will just need an external CC1101
